# ST7789 drivers for Micropython compatible with I80 bus and SPI
Because we dont (yet) have enough drivers for this chip.. :-)
- ToDo: Notes on MPDISPLAY and firmware based drivers like s3lcd as (good, faster) alternatives.

## A 'pure' framebuffer driver
Fully supports MicroPython's built in frameuffer, with no additional drawing, scrolling or font writng features.

## A modified version of @ TODO : REFS!
Supports I80 and SPI bus interfaces
?? PWM backlight control added
